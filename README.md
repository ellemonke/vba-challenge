# VBA-challenge
In this challenge, we were tasked to analyze stock data over several Excel worksheets/years and output results onto the first sheet.

- I used VBA to loop through each stock ticker and calculate the change in stock price over the year, the percent change, and total stock trading volume. 
- I used VBA number formatting and conditional formatting to highlight which stocks increased or decreased in price.
- I also used VBA to to look up the stock ticker with the greatest % increase in stock price, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume and output results.
- The VBA module was exported for use on any Excel spreadsheet with similar stock data.
